# deni.dk
This is the repository of my personal website, accessible at <https://deni.dk>. Last year I gave it a mayor overhaul, the site still doesn't use any JavaScript, and now uses all-vector graphics and a nice CSS background animation.

### Starscape
The starscape is an `svg` generated using a custom Python script utilizing [Jinja2](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/) to place 1.000 stars of different sizes randomly. It is then placed on the page with its upper left portion off-screen, to then be slowly dragged towards the bottom right corner, creating an "observatory" effect.

## Plans for the future
* Make the website available on IPv6
* Host the website on IPFS
