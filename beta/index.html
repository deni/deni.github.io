      <h1>Welcome</h1>
      <p>To my new website.</p>
      <p>I have wanted to update my website for some time now, but have not been able to find a theme that I was satisfied with. Last time, that ended with me hand-writing it. With this update, that same thing happened.</p>
      <p>I am really happy with how the star banner turned out. The actual stars is an SVG that I hand-wrote myself, assisted by a Python script that I wrote last year. I am thinking of writing a post just about that.</p>
      <p>With this new website, now comes to actually using it and writing blog-posts about some of all the different things that I do.</p>
      <p>I hope that you will come back soon and see how things have (hopefully!) evolved.</p>
      <p>All the best,</p>
      <p>Denis</p>
